      <p>Adventure of Blobby is a 2D platformer created in Unity on the PC and mobile platform. The game is about a lost blob trying its hardest to navigate through the dangerous forest, solving multiple puzzles and defeat spooky monsters to find and reach
        its family. The game focuses on the mechanics which allow Blobby to transform into different shapes to overcome the obstacles in the game.
      </p>
      <div class="flexContainer">
        <div class="flexItem2">
          <p>The team started the project by ideating the main mechanics and the theme of the game. We decided to to go for a 2d platformer that involves changing shapes. This allows us to reduce the amount of works on the assets, and be more focus on the
            core mechanics and gameplay of the game.
          </p>
          <p> In this project, my position was the level designer and programmer for the team. I had to create levels which allow the player to feel a sense of progression and challenges which creates a sense of enjoyment for the player. In the programming
            components, I programmed multiple traps and trigger in the game with some help from the teammates.

      <p>
        After multiple playtests, we were able to to get some feedback and suggestion from the play tester. We tried to implement as much of the fixes to our game as possilbe to make the game paly expirence feel responsive and smooth. The project as quite succesful
        as our first Unity game and we plan to import it in to the mobile plateform and continue to develop it in the near future.

        <h1 class="heading-two">Adrift VR</h1>

        <p>Adrift Vr is an immersive VR experience designed through Unity. This Vr experience is created to empathize on the connection between children and parents. Adrift Vr allow the audience the be fully immersed into the children’s dream through the
          first person simulation Our story is about parenting and spending more time with loved ones. The primary goal is to raise awareness in the fact that adults in today’s society are often too busy with work and neglect the importance of ensuring
          their children’s safety, both mentally and physically.
        </p>

        <div class="flexContainer">
          <div class="flexItem2">
            <p>The team started with affinity diagramming where each of the members brings up a random idea for the project. Through the session, we found that the team is more leaning toward the visual experience with some strong sensory and imaginative
              immersion. We wanted to include elements of exploring the environment with senses of curiosity. In the end, we agree on to create an experience that is able to bring awareness to parenting and the connection with children.

            </p>

            <p> In the team, we agreed on separating the different tasks to each of the members. Since each member has their strength and weakness, the task given to each member will be something that is part of the strength of the member to maximize the
              effectiveness of work. I was given the task of programing and some level design in Unity, since that is something that I am very comfortable with.
            </p>

        </div>

        <p> In the level design, I looked through many other examples of environments in games, such as Dear Esther and Lost, with the team. We discuss on what kind of feeling or story we trying to provide to the audience that is able to bring awareness to
          the relationship between children and parents. For the environment, I suggested the concept of “Observe and adapt” where we use a similar aesthetics of the environment for the other games and modify it to meet our need of communicating the message
          in the project. The team agrees with my idea of “Observe and adapt” and started looking for some of the elements where other games were able to successfully communicate with the audience. In the end, Our team was able to pull off the project
          with a lot of positive feedback from the audience during the showcase.
