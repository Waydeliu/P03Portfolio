      <p>
        Kaktus Und Panzer is an animated short film created with Maya. The story takes place In the African desert in World War 2 where the Axis started the African Campaign against the Allies colonies in Africa in 1940. In the film is showcases the Epic battle
        between the American Sherman tank and the German Tiger tank.

          <p>The team started the project though few brainstorming sessions where we found out that most of the member really like the concept of creating a tank battle animation. We wanted to feature the film with two of the most iconic tank of World War
            Two which is the Tiger and the Sherman. After the theme is set, as a group we started to create the storyboard for the animations and playing out the schedules for the modeling, rigging and doing the animations.

          <p>
            In this project, my main task was to create the model for the two tanks. To create these two tanks in Maya, Is used the blueprints of the two tanks as a reference when I was modeling which allow me to be quite precise in the scaling of the two tanks.
            After the model is done I started working on the rigging the tanks. For the tanksâ€™ movement, the team really want a realistic track movement. After multiple meeting with the team, we decided to take the programming approach with the track
            movement and physics.

      </div>

      <p>
        After making sure all the rigging is smooth, we moved on to creating the animation with the models. The animation process went fairly smoothly with all the scenes planned out beforehand, we were able to complete the animation ahead of the expected schedule.
        In the end, the project was very successful with audience liking a lot of the shots within the scenes.
