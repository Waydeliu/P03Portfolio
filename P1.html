      <p>Adventure of Blobby is a 2D platformer created in Unity on the PC and mobile platform. The game is about a lost blob trying its hardest to navigate through the dangerous forest, solving multiple puzzles and defeat spooky monsters to find and reach
        its family. The game focuses on the mechanics which allow Blobby to transform into different shapes to overcome the obstacles in the game.

          <p>The team started the project by ideating the main mechanics and the theme of the game. We decided to to go for a 2d platformer that involves changing shapes. This allows us to reduce the amount of work for the assets, and be more focus on the
            core mechanics and gameplay of the game.
          </p>
          <p> In this project, my position was the level designer and programmer for the team. I had to create levels which allow the player to feel a sense of progression and challenges which creates a sense of enjoyment for the player. In the programming
            components, I programmed multiple traps and trigger in the game with some help from the teammates.

      <p>
        After multiple playtests, we were able to to get some feedback and suggestion from the playtester. We tried to implement as much of the fixes to our game as possible to make the gameplay experience feel responsive and smooth. The project as quite successful
        as our first Unity game and we plan to import it into the mobile platform and continue to develop it in the near future.
